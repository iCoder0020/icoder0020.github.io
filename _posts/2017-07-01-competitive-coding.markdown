<b><font size = "5">A brief introduction about Competitive Coding.</font></b>

<font size = "3">
<p>Competitive Coding is a kind of activity in which many users over a network compete against each other, solving various kind of problems given by a person/group.</p>

<p>The participants are given certain questions in a particular input format, are expected to code their solutions in a programming language (the sites over the global network usually provide many options including C++, Python, Java, etc.) and finally print their answers according to various test cases provided by the server.</p>

<p>This type of coding helps the user to enhance their logic, thinking abilities, and coding speed simultaneously. As the difficulty of the questions increase, they demand a wider knowledge of algorithms and data structures, thus forcing the user to learn more and more everyday.</p>

<p>There are many sites one can find on the web through which one can take part in coding competitions; some examples are listed below:</p>
