<b><font size = "5">MicroWars</font></b>

<font size = "3">

<p>A C++ implementation of the popular indie game MicroWars</p>

<p>I worked along with <b>Rohan Prabhu Kunjibettu</b> to create this game. </p>

<p>We were able to successfully create the base of the game using concepts of OOP and multi-threading.

We added the feature of level making where we could customize the positions, power levels etc. of the orbs and teslas. We planned to add multi-player feature in it but thought it'd be wiser to first complete the CPU v/s player mode first.

However, since our next semester was closing in we couldn't make the AI part of the game which basically meant that the game doesn't even feature singleplayer games.

<p>We'll try to finish the game in the near future.</p>
