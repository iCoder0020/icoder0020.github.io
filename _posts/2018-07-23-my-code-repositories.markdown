<b><font size = "5">A collection of all codes I've used in competitions </font></b>

<font size = "3">

<p>I'm an enthusiast competitive coder, and try to take part in as many as contests as possible on various sites.</p>

<p>Here is <a href = "https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/iCoder0020">my profile</a> on StopStalk through which you may further use to view my code submissions on multiple coding platforms.</p>

<p>I've been competitive coding for around an year now, and thus naturally have a 150+ collection of solved problems, which I have preserved in <a href = "https://github.com/iCoder0020/Competitive-Coding">my repository</a></p>.

<p>Also here is a <a href = "https://github.com/iCoder0020/Miscellaneous">collection of some useful snippets of code</a> which come in handy when facing different kinds of competitive problems.</p>
